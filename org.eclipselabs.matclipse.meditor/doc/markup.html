    <h1>The markup langugage</h1>
    <p>The export functions don't provide their full potential until markup text is used. Markup text is included as matlab comment, but inside the comment a special syntax (based on Mediawiki) is used to declare a markup text. Meditor (and all other editors) displays such sections as standard matlab comment, but in exported files markup text represents headings, links, bold text, ...</p>
    <p>Matlab code is displayed in highlighted boxes. Each markup content breaks into such a box and occures like ordinary text. So it's also possible to write a document that consists mostly of normal text and some matlab code.</p>
    
    <p>This is a list of all implemented markup definitions.</p>
